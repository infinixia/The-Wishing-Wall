![](https://cloud-gxmey2111-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0prismify-render-1738345753296.png)

Project by [@Hrichik aka burger](https://github.com/hrichiksite) and [@OC](https://github.com/Gitstar-OC). 

The project is a website that shows all of the wishes of people that are made in the **#the-wishing-wall** channel of the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) slack channel. 

The backend of this complete project is made by [@Hrichik aka burger](https://github.com/hrichiksite) everything from exporting the message from setting up the api along with the admin key, time and data and every bit of text and iamge that you see on the site. 

The frontend is made by [@OC](https://github.com/Gitstar-OC) and is made with Next.js and Tailwind CSS along with a bit of a help from Shadcn UI. This project was bit of a challenge at first but now it is complete :) 


Me (OC) and [@Hrichik](https://github.com/hrichiksite) hope that you will like it.
